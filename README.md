# CloudComputingProject
Project is to move on premises setup to cloud(AWS).
This wright up is created to provide information during the transition of moving on premises computing and storage to an online service that can be scaled up easily during known peak demanding times.

The proposal that is being made to sm is for the use of AWS (Amazon Web Services). 
AWS not only provides a lot of services that are currently being used on premises, but there are also more services that can be used to not only increase the reliability of the usage in the infrastructure, but can also provide more features that can later be included.

The goal of this Assessment is to provide SMTAFE with an understanding of its capabilities to take advantage of rapidly developing offerings and changing pricing models in Cloud Services,
what cloud services may be appropriate for satisfying the agency’s needs, or both. The scope focuses on offering an assessment of SAAS for the following activities: 

•	Dater storage to be able to store files, folders, and VM data (virtual HDD) between AWS S3 and Azure storage
•	SQL DB to hold database queries for the website to read content from, between Azure database and AWS RDS
•	Web server to be able to host the website, between AWS VPC and Azure Web Hosting
•	Data encryption to securely store data in the cloud and provide a secure way to transfer data from local computer to cloud, between Azure encryption and AWS KMS
•	Access control to restrict user activities and access to the cloud services, between AWS IAM and Azure RBAC
•	Web firewall that can be used to limit internet access to the webserver (IP blocking, geolocation), between AWS WAF and Azure WAF
